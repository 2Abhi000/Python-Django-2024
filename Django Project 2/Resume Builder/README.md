<div>Resume builder makes the designing part easier and allows us to focus on our content and of course, our skills and projects. We can create a resume builder with the help of Django. The idea behind such Django projects is to help the user enter their content such as name, skills, work experience, certifications, websites, etc in a form. Later the data is converted into a professional resume design. The user can choose from one or more templates according to their preference.
